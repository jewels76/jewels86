Hello, I'm jewels (he/him). I'm a pentester and programmer in the C family and web development languages. I would love to collaborate on pretty much any project, honestly. 
You can reach me on discord at `jewels86`, over email at `jewels286@proton.me`, or, for privacy, you can reach me on Wire at `jewels86`.
Fun fact: I like naming my projects after gemstones

Projects I'm working on:
- Topaz: A dashboard/workspace site to manage everything in one place. (1%, started)
- Azotic Topaz: Topaz, but as a dasktop application. (1%)
- Tourmaline: A directory enumeration tool many modes. (50%)
- Aquamarine: A HTTP/HTTPS request automator. (0%)

I have a group named the Gold Team (name in progress) and we do development and white hat hacking. You can contact me to join!
